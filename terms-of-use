            registered Account for use of the Flair Services. When you use the
            Flair Services to make a payment, you consent to our use of a
            Payment Processor to facilitate and/or process payments made or
            received through the Flair Services, including, without limitation,
            consent to access, charge or debit a payer’s credit card, debit
            card, bank account or other payment mechanism. You agree to pay all
            Fees relating to your Transactions to us through the Payment
            Processor, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment
            provider (e.g., bank account) (“Payment Method”) through the Payment
            Processor. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms,
            conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition
            to this Agreement. We are not responsible for errors made by the
            Payment Processor.

            3. 4. 4 Your Account will be considered delinquent if payment in
            full is not successful when a charge is initiated. Unless specified
            in an invoice, amounts due are exclusive of all applicable taxes,
            levies, or duties, and you will be responsible for payment of all
            such amounts. If you believe that any specific charge under this
            Agreement is incorrect, in order to obtain a credit, you must
            contact us in writing within thirty (30) days after the payment due
            date, and set forth the nature and amount of the requested
            correction. Otherwise, charges are final.

            and/or terminate this Agreement if your Payment Method is declined
            or fails and your account therefore is delinquent.

          <h1>12. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</h1>
          <p>
            12. 1 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed and interpreted
            in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, USA without
            reference to conflicts of laws principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 2 Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement
            carefully. It is part of your contract with Flair and affects your
            rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND
            A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation
            where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the
            parties’ dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide
            parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less
            formal than court proceedings. The following procedures apply to all
            arbitration proceedings involving you and us.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 3 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and
            disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief
            as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any
            product or service provided by Flair that cannot be resolved
            informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding
            arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this
            Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration
            proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement
            applies to you and Flair, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates,
            agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and
            assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or
            beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 4 Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before
            either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the
            other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the
            nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.
            A Notice to Flair should be sent to: Flair Technologies, Inc., 100
            SE 2nd St. STE 2000 Miami, FL 33131 or such other location as Flair
            may direct. After the Notice is received, you and Flair may attempt
            to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Flair do not
            resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the
            Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration
            proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may
            not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has
            determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
            entitled.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 5 Rules for Arbitration. Any dispute, claim or controversy
            arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach,
            termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof,
            including the determination of the scope or applicability of this
            agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration before
            one arbitrator in Miami, Florida, unless the parties agree to a
            different location. The arbitration shall be administered pursuant
            to JAMS's Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS
            Rules”). The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve
            any arbitrability issues including any dispute over these Terms or
            this arbitration provision’s scope, application, meaning, and
            enforceability. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever
            relief would be available in court. Any award of the arbitrator(s)
            shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any
            court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties
            from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court
            of appropriate jurisdiction. The one exception to the exclusivity of
            arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an
            individual claim against the other in a small claims court of
            competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding
            party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court
            instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims
            court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made
            before an arbitrator has been appointed, any open arbitration
            between the parties shall be administratively closed. If an
            arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall determine
            whether the dispute should remain in arbitration or instead be
            decided in small claims court. Arbitration shall be conducted by
            written submissions only, unless either you or Flair invoke the
            right to an oral hearing before the arbitrator.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 6 Time Limits. If you or Flair pursue arbitration, the
            arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
            statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim)
            and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the
            pertinent claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 7 Waiver of Jury Trial. You and Flair expressly and knowingly
            WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. This means that if for any reason
            the Arbitration Agreement contained in Section 12 is not enforced or
            is found inapplicable, or either of us file the action in small
            claims court, our claims against each other will be resolved by a
            judge rather than a jury.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 8 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND
            DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
            ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS
            BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE
            ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
            OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. 9 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding,
            including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and
            compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties
            agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.
            This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court
            of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to
            enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable
            relief.

          <p>
            13. 3 Electronic Communications. The communications between you and
            Flair use electronic means, whether you use the Flair Services or
            send us emails, or whether Flair posts notices on the Flair Services
            or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you
            (a) consent to receive communications from Flair in an electronic
            form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements,
            notices, disclosures, and other communications that Flair provides
            to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
            communications be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not
            affect your non-waivable rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            13. 4 Publicity. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are
            confidential, and you agree that you will not disclose such terms
            and conditions or issue any press releases or other public
            statements relating to the relationship created by this Agreement
            without Flair’s prior written approval. Flair shall be permitted to
            list you as a customer in Flair’s marketing materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            13. 5 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for failure or
            delay in performing its obligations because of causes beyond its
            reasonable control, including without limitation acts of God,
            terrorism, war, riots, fire, earthquake, flood or degradation or
            failure of third-party networks or communications infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            13. 6 Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
            between you and us regarding the use of the Flair Services. Our
            failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms
            shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The
            section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no
            legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including
            without limitation”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any
            reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of
            these Terms will be unimpaired, and the invalid or unenforceable
            provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and
            enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your
            relationship to Flair is that of an independent contractor, and
            neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and
            your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned,
            subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without
            Flair’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment,
            subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing
            will be null and void. Flair may freely assign these Terms. The
            terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon
            assignees.
