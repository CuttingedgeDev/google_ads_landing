      <p>
        Our Services may permit you the opportunity to provide us with Personal
        Information. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information”
        means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination
        with other information, to personally identify an individual or
        household as defined by applicable state laws as noted below.  We collect certain information, including Personal Information, from and

      <h5>Automatically, When You Use, or Your Devices Uses, Our Services</h4>
      <p style = 'font-size: 20px; margin-top:-17px;'>
        We may automatically collect data about you when you use our Services
        including the website. This information is primarily needed to maintain
        the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal
        analytics so that we can improve our products and Services. This may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>device and usage information, such as your IP address</li>
        <li>browser and device characteristics</li>

        <li>
          “cookies” and other tracking technologies like pixel tags and web
          beacons, often called “smart cookies” (more information about cookies
          is below)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 style = 'font-size:25px; margin-bottom:1;'>Cookies and Web Beacons</h5>
      <p>
        Cookies are text files that are sent by servers to web browsers and
        stored on your computer. They tell us which parts of our Services you’ve
        visited so we can alert you to software compatibility issues and save
        your preferences for future visits to our Services. Web beacons and
        pixel tags are images embedded in a webpage or e-mail for the purpose of
        measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Our Services, or third-party
        service providers acting on our behalf, may use web beacons and pixel
        tags to help us analyze usage and improve our functionality. Some
        cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information
        previously provided by a user.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use information collected from cookies and other technologies to
        improve your user experience and the overall quality of our Services. We
        use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, your usage of our
        Services, and your access preferences. We may use your Personal
        Information to see which web pages you visit at our websites, which
        website you visited before coming to our website, and where you go after
        you leave our website. We can then develop statistics that help us
        understand how our visitors use our websites and how to improve them. If
        you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you should set
        your browsers to refuse cookies before using our Services. Please
        understand that if you do so, you may not be able to fully utilize our
        Services and therefore we disclaim, and you hereby waive, any claim or
        liability that may arise due to your partial or incomplete access to the
        content of any of our Services as a result thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the features of our Services may use cookies or other methods to
        gather information regarding your use of the Services, and may combine
        the information in these cookies with any Personal Information about you
        that they may have. The use of such information by a third party depends
        on the privacy policy of that third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since sponsors or partners of the website may use their own cookies when
        you click on a hypertext link to their website or service, you should
        carefully review the privacy policy of other websites to which you link
        from our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        A “web beacon,” “clear GIF,” “web bug,” or “pixel tag” is a tiny graphic
        file with a unique identifier that is similar in function to a cookie,
        but would allow us to count the number of users that have visited
        certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help determine the
        effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in
        HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether
        and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be
        stored on your computer’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded
        invisibly on pages or screens. We may use web beacons in providing the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics monitored by
        cookies and web beacons with our affiliates and partner companies.

        Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of interest-based advertising
        for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile
        device. For more information, please check your mobile settings.

        We may use Google Analytics on our site to help us analyze the traffic
        on our site. For more information on Google Analytics’ processing of

        We do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose the Personal
        Information collected from our Services to third parties unless
        otherwise stated below or with your consent.
      </p>
      <ul style = 'display: grid; gap: 5px;'>
        <li>
          Service Providers & Contractors. We may provide Personal Information
          to service providers and contractors to perform tasks on our behalf
          and to assist us in providing our Services. These service providers
          and contractors assist us with various tasks, including marketing
          agencies, design firms, partners/profit sharing partnered businesses
          for promotional purposes. We do not allow these parties to use your
          information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and
          we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data
          they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Event of Merger, Sale, Divestitures or Change of Control. We
          may transfer or assign Personal Information to an entity that acquires
          or is merged with us as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other
          change of control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other Disclosures. We may disclose Personal Information about you if
          we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is
          helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable
          law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce
          our terms of use, including investigations of potential violations
          thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security

          Authorized Representatives. If another individual is managing your
          account on your behalf (for example, a wife managing the account of
          her husband), as authorized by you or as a personal representative
          under applicable law, that person can view all Personal Information
          about you in Our Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may share de-identified and/or aggregate analytics with third-party
          partners about how users interact with our Services, including usage

        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5 style = 'margin-bottom: 0px;'>Do Not Track Disclosure</h4>
      <p>
        Many web browsers include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting that
        signals your preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities monitored and collected. However, there is currently no
        uniform standard for recognizing and implementing the DNT signals. As
        such, Flair does not monitor or respond to Do Not Track browser
        requests. If a standard is adopted that we must follow in the future,
        then we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h5>Information Security</h4>
      <p>
        No application can guarantee security, but we maintain industry accepted
        physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal
        Information collected via our Services in compliance with applicable
        law.
      </p>
      <h5>Third Party Websites</h4>
      <p>
        Our Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or
        mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties
        that are not affiliated with us—and which may link to other websites,
        services, or applications. Please be aware that Flair is not responsible
        for the privacy or practices of other websites or third parties. We do
        not make any guarantee regarding those third-party websites, services,
        or applications, and we are not liable for any loss or damage caused by
        the use of such sites. Any data collected by third parties is not
        covered by this Privacy Policy. You should review the policies of the
        third parties and contact them directly if you have any questions about
        their services.
      </p>
      <h5>Your Choices About Your Information</h4>
      <p>
        You have choices about how we use your information. Please understand
        that if you choose not to disclose information to us, it may affect your
        ability to use some features of our services or products.
      </p>
      <h5>Marketing</h4>
      <p>
        If you are a registered user of our Services or have supplied your email
        address, you agree that in addition to any Services you may have
        solicited or requested, Flair may further send you emails to provide you
        with information, to inform you of new products, to solicit your
        feedback, or to keep you up to date on Flair and its products.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can opt out of our marketing and promotional communications at any
        time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,
        replying “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” to the SMS messages that we send. You
        also may ask us not to send you other marketing communications by
        contacting us as specified in the "Contact Us" section below, and we
        will honor your request. Please note that even after you are removed
        from our marketing lists, we may still send you non-promotional
        communications, such as responding to service requests.
      </p>
      <h5>Information Retention</h4>
      <p>
        We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes for which we collect the information, as described
        in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or
        permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize your
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h5>Children</h4>
      <p>
        Our Services are not intended for use by children. We do not
        intentionally gather Personal Information from individuals who are under
        the age of 16. If you believe that we might have any information from a
        child under age 16 without consent of a parent or guardian, please
        contact us at. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the
        Personal Information of a child under 16 without proper consent, or
        equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to
        delete the information as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <h5>International Users</h4>
      <p>
        The Service is hosted in the United States and is intended solely for
        visitors located within the United States. If you do not reside in the
        United States and provide personal data to us, please note that your
        Personal Information will be transferred, processed, collected, used,
        accessed and/or stored in the United States and subject to U.S. laws.
        The laws in the United States may not provide the same protections for
        your Personal Information as the jurisdiction in which you are located.
        Do not provide your Personal Information to us if you do not want this
        information to be transferred or processed outside of your country, or
        if the laws in your country restrict such transfers.
      </p>

      <h4>Identity Verification</h4>
      <p>
        If you request to access, correct, or delete Personal Information, we
        will need to verify your identity before processing your request. When
        you make such a request, you can expect the following:
      </p>
      <ul style="display: grid; gap: 8px">
        <li>
          We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us with your
          email address, and full name. We may ask for additional information if
          needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will confirm that you want your information accessed, corrected,
          and/or deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you
          have not received a response within a few days after that, please let
          us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may
          need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, but we will
          reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we need an
          extension, we will explain why.
        </li>
        <li>
          In certain cases, a request for access, correction, or deletion may be
          denied. For example, if we cannot verify your identity, the law
          requires that we maintain the information, or if we need the
          information for internal purposes such as providing Services or
          completing an order. If we deny your request, we will explain why we
          denied it and delete any other information that is not protected and
          subject to denial.
