            This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers our privacy practices

            read this Privacy Policy and consent to Flair’s privacy practices as
            described in the Privacy Policy, including our use and disclosure of
            your Personal Information for the purposes described below. You
            further affirm your consent by submitting content or materials to or
            through our Services.

          <p>
            IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
            PRACTICES DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CEASE ANY ACCESS OR

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            Our Services may permit you the opportunity to provide us with
            Personal Information. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal
            Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or
            in combination with other information, to personally identify an
            individual or household as defined by applicable state laws as noted
            below. We collect certain information, including Personal
            Information, from and about our users in two ways:

            If you share with us information about other people (for example, if

          <p>
            We may automatically collect data about you when you use our
            Services including the website. This information is primarily needed
            to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
            internal analytics so that we can improve our products and Services.
            This may include:

            <li>device and usage information, such as your IP address</li>

              “cookies” and other tracking technologies like pixel tags and web

              cookies is below)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are text files that are sent by servers to web browsers and
            stored on your computer. They tell us which parts of our Services
            you’ve visited so we can alert you to software compatibility issues
            and save your preferences for future visits to our Services. Web
            beacons and pixel tags are images embedded in a webpage or e-mail
            for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Our
            Services, or third-party service providers acting on our behalf, may
            use web beacons and pixel tags to help us analyze usage and improve
            our functionality. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to
            recall Personal Information previously provided by a user.
          </p>
          <p>
            use information collected from cookies and other technologies to
            improve your user experience and the overall quality of our
            Services. We use cookies to help us identify and track visitors,
            your usage of our Services, and your access preferences. We may use
            your Personal Information to see which web pages you visit at our
            websites, which website you visited before coming to our website,
            and where you go after you leave our website. We can then develop
            statistics that help us understand how our visitors use our websites
            and how to improve them. If you do not wish to have cookies placed
            on your computer, you should set your browsers to refuse cookies
            before using our Services. Please understand that if you do so, you
            may not be able to fully utilize our Services and therefore we
            disclaim, and you hereby waive, any claim or liability that may
            arise due to your partial or incomplete access to the content of any
            of our Services as a result thereof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the features of our Services may use cookies or other
            methods to gather information regarding your use of the Services,
            and may combine the information in these cookies with any Personal
            Information about you that they may have. The use of such
            information by a third party depends on the privacy policy of that
            third party. Since sponsors or partners of the website may use their
            own cookies when you click on a hypertext link to their website or
            service, you should carefully review the privacy policy of other
            websites to which you link from our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            A “web beacon,” “clear GIF,” “web bug,” or “pixel tag” is a tiny
            graphic file with a unique identifier that is similar in function to
            a cookie, but would allow us to count the number of users that have
            visited certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help
            determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
            When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the
            sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to
            cookies, which may be stored on your computer’s hard drive, web
            beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens. We may
            use web beacons in providing the Services. We reserve the right to
            share aggregated site statistics monitored by cookies and web
            beacons with our affiliates and partner companies.

              on our behalf and to assist us in providing our Services. These
              service providers and contractors assist us with various tasks,
              including marketing agencies, design firms, partners/profit
              sharing partnered businesses for promotional purposes. We do not

              Other Disclosures. We may disclose Personal Information about you

              is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any
              applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request;

          <h2>Do Not Track Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            Many web browsers include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
            that signals your preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. However, there is
            currently no uniform standard for recognizing and implementing the
            DNT signals. As such, Flair does not monitor or respond to Do Not
            Track browser requests. If a standard is adopted that we must follow
            in the future, then we will inform you about that practice in a
            revised version of this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h2>Information Security</h2>

          <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
          <p>
            Our Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or
            mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties
            that are not affiliated with us—and which may link to other
            websites, services, or applications. Please be aware that Flair is
            not responsible for the privacy or practices of other websites or
            third parties. We do not make any guarantee regarding those
            third-party websites, services, or applications, and we are not
            liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such sites. Any
            data collected by third parties is not covered by this Privacy

          <h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            You have choices about how we use your information. Please
            understand that if you choose not to disclose information to us, it
            may affect your ability to use some features of our services or
            products.
          </p>
          <h2>Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user of our Services or have supplied your
            email address, you agree that in addition to any Services you may
            have solicited or requested, Flair may further send you emails to
            provide you with information, to inform you of new products, to
            solicit your feedback, or to keep you up to date on Flair and its
            products. You can opt out of our marketing and promotional
            communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
            the emails that we send, replying “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” to the SMS
            messages that we send. You also may ask us not to send you other
            marketing communications by contacting us as specified in the
            "Contact Us" section below, and we will honor your request. Please
            note that even after you are removed from our marketing lists, we
            may still send you non-promotional communications, such as
            responding to service requests.
          </p>
          <h2>Information Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary
            to fulfill the purposes for which we collect the information, as
            described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period
            is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
            legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business
            need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or
            anonymize your information, or, if this is not possible (for
            example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup
            archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <h2>Children</h2>
          <p>
            Our Services are not intended for use by children. We do not
            intentionally gather Personal Information from individuals who are
            under the age of 16. If you believe that we might have any
            information from a child under age 16 without consent of a parent or
            guardian, please contact us at. If we learn that we have
            inadvertently collected the Personal Information of a child under 16
            without proper consent, or equivalent minimum age depending on
            jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon
            as possible.
          </p>
          <h2>International Users</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is hosted in the United States and is intended solely
            for visitors located within the United States. If you do not reside
            in the United States and provide personal data to us, please note
            that your Personal Information will be transferred, processed,
            collected, used, accessed and/or stored in the United States and
            subject to U.S. laws. The laws in the United States may not provide
            the same protections for your Personal Information as the
            jurisdiction in which you are located. Do not provide your Personal
            Information to us if you do not want this information to be
            transferred or processed outside of your country, or if the laws in
            your country restrict such transfers.

            separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar
            year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; and (b) the
            names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above
            information, please contact us at with a reference to California
            Disclosure Information. This section contains disclosures required

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            If you request to access, correct, or delete Personal Information,
            we will need to verify your identity before processing your request.
            When you make such a request, you can expect the following:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 0">
            <li>
              We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us with
              your email address, and full name. We may ask for additional
              information if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will confirm that you want your information accessed,
              corrected, and/or deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you
              have not received a response within a few days after that, please
              let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed
              below.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we
              may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, but
              we will reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we
              need an extension, we will explain why.
            </li>
            <li>
              In certain cases, a request for access, correction, or deletion
              may be denied. For example, if we cannot verify your identity, the
              law requires that we maintain the information, or if we need the
              information for internal purposes such as providing Services or
              completing an order. If we deny your request, we will explain why
              we denied it and delete any other information that is not
              protected and subject to denial.
